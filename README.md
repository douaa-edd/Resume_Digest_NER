# 📄 Resume_Digest_NER – Smart CV Parsing with BERT & spaCy

**Resume_Digest_NER** is a lightweight Streamlit-based web application that allows HR professionals and recruiters to automatically extract and structure key information from CVs (PDF format) using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built with **spaCy** and **BERT (bert-base-cased)**.



## 🚀 Key Features

- 📥 Upload multiple resumes in **PDF** format  
- 🧠  Intelligent information extraction using a **fine-tuned BERT** model (bert-base-cased)
- 📄 Extracted fields:
  - First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender
  - Phone, Email, Address
  - Skills, Diplomas, Languages, Work Experience, Others
- 📊 Outputs structured data in a downloadable **Excel (XLSX)** file  
- 🖥️ Clean and intuitive **Streamlit** web interface  



## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Accelerate CV processing and analysis for HR teams
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of **BERT + spaCy** in real-world information extraction tasks
- Provide a simple, extensible NLP solution that is easy to use



## 🧠 Model Details
The system is based on a **pre-trained Transformer model**, bert-base-cased, fine-tuned for the specific task of named entity recognition in CVs.
